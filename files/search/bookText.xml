This book is intended as a work of fiction based on some moral lessons .]]></page><page Index="3"><![CDATA[Beth was a very resourceful and conservative mouse. She knew that winter was coming and that
there would soon be a dearth of food. So she decided to make gathering food for winter her
primary job. Gathering food was a grueling and mundane activity, but Beth made a deliberate
effort because she knew that it was important. She allotted herself a few hours every day to collect
beans. By winter, she had collected a massive pile and hid them in a cache.]]></page><page Index="4"><![CDATA[Beth had a sister named Mary. Mary lacked ambition. She had fanciful ideas about how she would
survive winter. She thought that food would just come to her and that she could work at her own
convenience. She opted to spend the days playing and dancing, instead of gathering beans. When
the final hours of autumn elapsed, Mary had only a paltry amount of food stored away.]]></page><page Index="5"><![CDATA[Mary realized that her food supply was too small to last through winter. She
visited her sister.
Mary said,

                          “Beth, l am in a dire situation. I didn’t
                          gather enough food for winter. Will you
                          let me share your beans? Please have
                          some empathy for your sister!”]]></page><page Index="6"><![CDATA[Beth thought for a moment. Then she replied,

                                 “Mary, I am truly sorry for you. But I will not give
                                 you any of my beans. Instead, I will let you have
                                 my empty bag. You can still work hard and gather
                                 enough food for the winter. It will be tedious, but
                                 you will learn the value of hard work.”]]></page><page Index="7"><![CDATA[Beth’s words appalled Mary. Mary cried with outrage,

                        “There is too much work! I
                        won’t have any time to dance
                        or play!”]]></page><page Index="8"><![CDATA[Mary griped some more, but she knew that her sister was right. She took the bag
and went to work gathering her own beans for the winter.]]></page><page Index="9"><![CDATA[Beth said,

            “It is crucial that you gather enough food.
            You must have sustenance before you have
            fun. Go now, and rectify your situation.”]]></page><page Index="10"><![CDATA[]]></page></pages></Search>
